<!-- HTML Links : HTML links are hyperlinks. You can click on a link and jump to another document.
            The HTML <a> tag defines a hyperlink.
            The most important attribute of the <a> element is the href attribute, which indicates the link's destination.
            The link text is the part that will be visible to the reader.
            The target attribute specifies where to open the linked document.
            The target attribute can have one of the following values:
                _self - Default. Opens the document in the same window/tab as it was clicked
                _blank - Opens the document in a new window or tab
                _parent - Opens the document in the parent frame
                _top - Opens the document in the full body of the window
